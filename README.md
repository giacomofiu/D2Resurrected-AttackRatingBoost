# D2Resurrected-AttackRatingBoost
A Diablo 2 Resurrected mod which boosts attack rating of melee attacks for both your character and mercenaries.

## How to install
Download mod files.

Go in your D2Resurrected installation directory and create (if don't exist) directories "mods\arboost\arboost.mpq\data\global\excel" (each directory at the right of \ goes into the previous one).

Copy file "modinfo.json" into "arboost.mpq" dir, then copy .txt files into "excel" dir.

Open Diablo 2 Resurrected launcher, go to game settings, check "Additional command line arguments", at the end of your existing arguments (if any) add a white space and write "-mod arboost -txt" without quotes (if there are no arguments white space at the beginning is not needed).

Backup your save files for safety.

Go in your D2Resurrected save game folder and create (if don't exist) directories "mods\arboost", here will go the save files for this mod; you can copy your current save files inside this directory and use your characters.

Start the game, enjoy!

This mod is compatible with your save files and is offline only.
